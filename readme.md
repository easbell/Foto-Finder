# Foto Finder
This project entailed developing an app called Foto Finder. The goal was to match a comp as closely as possible with HTML and CSS and implement functionality with JavaScript. When a user enters a title, caption, and image file, they will be created as cards on the DOM. Using JSON , each photo and associated info is saved in local storage in order for cards to persist after page load. By utilizing object-oriented JavaScript, each card was saved as an object in an images array.

# Areas of Growth
This was my first solo JavaScript project. Writing and implement every piece of code allowed a much deeper understanding of array prototypes and the use of classes and object. While continuing to improve upon my HTML and CSS skills, this project helped solidify the past six weeks of learning.
